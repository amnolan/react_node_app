# react_node_app
Basic starter react app

For the backend logic install the express dependency:

    npm i express
    
Start it up:

    npm start
    
Generate a front end application in react (note: you don't have to do this because it has already been created, notice the client folder):

    npx create-react-app client
    
Move into the correct directory and start it up:

    cd client
    npm start
